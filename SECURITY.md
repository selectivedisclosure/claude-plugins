# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests — a public report is itself a disclosure.

Instead, use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/selectivedisclosure/claude-plugins/security/advisories/new) to open a draft advisory. It's private, and it lets us work on the fix and the advisory in the same place.

Please include:

- what the problem is and why it's a security issue rather than a bug;
- the catalogue entry affected, and the commit you're looking at;
- steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept;
- what an attacker could achieve with it.

## What counts as a vulnerability here

This repo ships **one JSON manifest** and no code. Nothing here executes on your machine. What it does do is tell Claude Code which repositories to fetch plugins from, so the realistic threat is the manifest pointing somewhere it should not:

- **An entry pointing at the wrong repository** — a typosquat, a fork, or a transferred or renamed repo whose old name someone else has since claimed. The catalogue is the only thing asserting that a plugin name like `selectivedisclosure-skills` means a particular `selectivedisclosure/...` repository, so an entry that lies is the whole attack.
- **A compromise of a repository this catalogue points at.** Report it against that repository, not this one — but tell us here too, because the fix here is to pull the entry while the other repo is dealt with.
- **A compromise of this repository's own supply chain** — its workflows, or anything with write access to `main`.

Reports about a _plugin's_ behaviour — a skill that gives poor advice, or fires when it shouldn't — belong in that plugin's own repository. This catalogue only names it.

## Known accepted risk: entries are not pinned

Catalogue entries carry no `ref` or `sha`. Each one tracks its plugin repository's default branch, so an install or update fetches whatever is on `main` at that moment. A bad commit reaching a plugin's `main` therefore reaches users without any change landing here.

That is a deliberate tradeoff, not an oversight — pinning would mean a commit in this repo for every release in a plugin repo, which is exactly the coupling this catalogue exists to remove. It is acceptable because every catalogued repository is first-party with CI gating `main`. It would not be acceptable for third-party entries, which is one reason there are none.

Reporting it as a vulnerability is not useful. Reporting a specific bad commit that reached users through it is.

## Supported versions

This catalogue is not versioned and has no releases. Only the current `main` branch exists, and it is the only thing supported — a fix is a commit to `main`, and users pick it up on the next `claude plugin marketplace update selectivedisclosure-plugins`.

The plugins listed here version independently, in their own repositories, under their own security policies.

## What to expect

This repo is maintained by one person in their own time, so there's no guaranteed response time and no bug bounty. Reports are read and handled on a best-effort basis.

If a report is valid, the fix lands on `main` and a GitHub advisory is published. Credit is given to the reporter unless you'd rather stay anonymous — say which you prefer in the report.
